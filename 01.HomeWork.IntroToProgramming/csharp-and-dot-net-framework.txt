C# is a programming language while the .NET framework is often used to describe both the application framework library and the .NET Framework Common Language Runtime. Basically a programmer would use the language C# to write a set of instructions that tell the platform (computer, mobile device, etc.) to do a certain task. The platform, on the other hand needs to understand this language and thus we have the .NET Framework and FCL - a "dictionary" of sorts, that tells the OS that <Console.WriteLine)"Hello World!")> should print that line in the console.
